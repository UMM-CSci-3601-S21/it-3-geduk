- [Improvements:](#improvements)

## Known Issues:
* These is an object object error thrown in the karma tests. It has been derived from the last iteration.
* The Merriam Webster Dictionary make take some time to return a suggestion with the new changes we made to add word.
* No limits for length of word and forms, amount of forms for each word, 

## Improvements:
* Test Coverage for the features implemented in this iteration can be improved for karma tests and E2E tests. E2E tests don't test the features in extreme depth. Karma tests can be improved for previous and new features.
* Refactor the files, there seems to be a lot of files, which makes it difficult to understand whats going on in the project.
