## Purpose

For teachers who wish to support beginners’ engagement with language,
Word River is a tool that supports the management and analysis of language exploration.
Unlike managing all of this information by hand, our product makes it easy to manage what words are available (through the creation, viewing, and assignment of personalized content) and understand more about a learner’s exploration and progress (by providing information about language exposure and the results of various activities).

* **Export A Contextpack:** user can export a context pack in JSON format to be used elsewhere.
* **Change Contextpack Name**: user can change the name of the contextpack.
* **Change Contextpack Enable Value**: user can the enabled value of the contextpack.
